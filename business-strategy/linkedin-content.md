## DM/Call Pitch Scripts

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch
"I help startups and growing businesses build scalable software solutions that drive real results. I'm a senior full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience - I work directly with clients, no agencies or middlemen. Recently helped a startup increase conversions by 300% and secure $2M in funding with a custom platform I built. What's your biggest technical challenge right now?"

### 2-Minute Discovery Pitch
"I specialize in helping companies like yours solve complex technical challenges quickly and cost-effectively. Unlike agencies, you work directly with me - faster decisions, clearer communication, and personal investment in your success.

My sweet spot is working with startups and SMBs who need senior-level expertise but can't justify a full-time hire. I handle everything from MVP development to AI integration to cloud migrations.

Recent example: helped a manufacturing company implement AI customer service that reduced their support costs by 60% while improving customer satisfaction to 95%.

What I'm curious about is - what's your biggest technical bottleneck right now? Is it scaling your current system, building new features, or maybe exploring AI capabilities?"

### Objection Handling Scripts

**"We're not ready to invest in custom development"**
"I understand budget is always a consideration. That's exactly why I offer a free 30-minute consultation first. Often, I can identify quick wins that pay for themselves within months. For example, one client saved $50K annually just by automating their customer service - the project paid for itself in 2 months."

**"We already have developers"**
"That's great! I'm not looking to replace your team - I work alongside existing developers as a senior technical advisor. Think of it as adding a CTO-level resource without the full-time commitment. I can help with architecture decisions, code reviews, and tackling the complex problems your team might not have time for."

**"We need to think about it"**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specific concerns do you have? Is it timeline, budget, or technical approach? I'm happy to address any questions and provide references from similar projects. Would it help to see a detailed proposal with timeline and deliverables?"
